Yeah, yeah
Who told you bad man don't dance?
Who told you gangsters don't dance?
Even with a wap on my hip, I dance
Bad man, take another sip and dance
Two left feet, don't trip and dance
The gyal want me, I might give her a chance
Give her a look, she give me a glance
She wore that tight dress just to enhance
Your likkle bum-bum
Never seen you before, where you come from?
You got a fat pum-pum, I got a long Johnson
I know I never met you at random
This must be destiny, that's why you're next to me
You feel like ecstasy
This must be destiny, that's why you're next to me
You feel like ecstasy
Who told you bad man don't dance?
Who told you gangsters don't dance?
Even with a wap on my hip, I dance
Bad man, take another sip and dance
Two left feet, don't trip and dance
The gyal want me, I might give her a chance
Give her a look, she give me a glance
She wore that tight dress just to enhance
